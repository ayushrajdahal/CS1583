# HW3 - Topics for Discussion

### 1. Printf-like formatting (Confusion, Chapter 2 Section 4)

It would be helpful to go over how we can use formatting similar to printf while manipulating variables (as opposed to just printing out the values).

### 2. Short-Circuit Evaluation, Boolean Logical Exclusive OR (Interesting, Chapter 4 Section 8)

Boolean Exclusive OR (^) is something that I believe we missed implementing properly during our lectures. It would be interesting to go over more problems that this operator could be used for solving. Short-Circuit Evaluation is also a somewhat non-intuitive concept and it would be great if we could go over it once more.

### 3. Primitive and non-primitive data types (Confusion, Chapter 3 Section 13)

I am confused about what makes the String data type non-primitive, as opposed to primitive types like, say, int and float that also store some form of data. What would be the implications of having int as a non-primitive data type in Java and enabling methods into it for convenience?

### 4. While vs. For loop use cases (Interesting, Chapter 4, Section 3 & 5)

For loop also uses condition within the parentheses and has cases where it runs in an infinite loop. So, how is for loop different than having a while loop and breaking out of it when needed (or when a certain value is reached, just like in for loop)? I think this is an interesting idea to ponder about when deciding between the two types of loops in our problems.

### 5. Break vs. Continue (Confusion, Chapter 4 Section 7)

Although it is clear that both break and continue are used to exit skip the loop, I still sometimes tend to get confused about when I should use each. It might be helpful for us to go through a few more problems that make it more intuitive.
